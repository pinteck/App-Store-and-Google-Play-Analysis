# Analysing App Store and Google Play for a Profitable App Idea
My goal for this project is to analyse data to give app developers an understanding about what kind of apps are expected to attract more users. In this imaginary scenario I work as a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps and I aim to enable the developer team to make data-driven decisions.

The project analyses free Ios and Android Apps according their attractiveness by users. This is my first project on dataquest.io Data Scientist in Python path. The aim of this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.
